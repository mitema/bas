Whether commemorating favorite films from every genre and decade or creating acclaimed original programming, the AMC experience celebrates great stories.  AMC's origin  l stories include the critically acclaimed dramas Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and The Killing.  AMC launched in 1984 as American Movie Classics.IFC creates and champions authentic, original content that is ""Always On. Slightly Off."" Since 1994, IFC has cultivated television programming that challenges the conventions of storytelling.  Today, IFC continues to embrace content with an indie perspective.  Original series - headlined by brand-defining scripted and sketch comedy such as Onion News Network and Portlandia - air alongside an extraordinary collection of films and cult TV shows.  IFC’s long and short-form original content inspired by music, web, gaming, animation, news, and culture is available on multiple platforms.Sundance Channel is the destination for What’s Next, Now.  Showcasing both today’s creative icons and the emerging talent of tomorrow, Sundance Channel tells credible, authentic and emotionally immersive stories of invention, fashion, film, travel, design and enterprise.  The network’s originals include the social media phenomenon Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys and All on the Line starring Joe Zee.  Launched in 1996, the network provides perspectives dedicated to founder Robert Redford's mission to celebrate creativity.  Sundance Channel was acquired by Rainbow Media in 2008.WE tv is the women’s network devoted to the wild ride of relationships during life’s defining moments.  The original series and hit wedding shows, including Braxton Family Values, Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?, Bridezillas and My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, underscore the network’s brand position and tagline, Life As WE Know It, which signifies the connection that women share based on similar life experiences.  WE tv launched in 1997 and was originally branded Romance Classics.IFC Films consists of multiple brands that are devoted to bringing the best of specialty films to the largest possible audience: Sundance Selects, IFC Films, IFC Midnight, IFC Productions, IFC Center and SundanceNow.  IFC Films pioneered a distribution model that makes independent films available to a national audience by releasing them in theaters as well as on demand.  All three of their distribution labels currently utilize this unique model: Sundance Selects, a leading U.S. distributor of prestige films that focuses on American independents, documentaries and world cinema; IFC Films, a leading U.S. distributor of high profile talent-driven independent film; and IFC Midnight,a leading U.S. distributor of genre entertainment, including horror, science-fiction, thrillers, erotic art house, action and more.  The division also operates IFC Productions, a feature film production company that provides financing for select independent film projects; IFC Center, a five screen, state-of-the-art cinema in the heart of New York's Greenwich Village; and SundanceNow, an online destination where consumers can rent or buy the best in contemporary and classic independent films from all over world.",,"Woodland Hills, CA+1 location",,,"New York, NY","<ul><li>New York, NY</li></ul>",https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Amc-Networks,http://www.amcnetworks.com,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=86755556359d5c5c&fccid=490d2f31522bb345&vjs=3

 Doctor Evidence is the leading medical intelligence platform for Life Sciences companies that enables users to identify breakthrough insights grounded in the vast universe of published medical information, proprietary data and real world evidence. We push the boundaries of healthcare technology and allow for new possibilities in science, enabling more informed decision making and faster time-to-market for accelerated impact. Our vision is to empower smarter healthcare decisions with better evidence and insights. Our mission is to use intelligent, cutting edge technology and expertise to deliver evidence-based answers and meaningful healthcare insights. Our values are: let the evidence speak for itself; respect each other’s time, ideas and perspective; generate better products with diverse ideas; stay hungry for knowledge; and be agile, adaptive and innovative.



 **Job Description**


 Doctor Evidence builds solutions used by doctors, educators, scientists, researchers, biomedical informaticians and manufacturers that enable enormous advances for the improvement of human health, including COVID-19 research. We are looking for an experienced JavaScript Developer to contribute to our advanced biomedical analytics application. You should have an aptitude for tackling user interface and workflow challenges unique to big data analyses and complex scientific workflows.



  
 A good fit would be a developer who loves to learn and can execute quickly while still following best practices and who thrives on new technology and has an avid interest in bioinformatics and big data. You will be expected to help make decisions on and implement design, behavior, functionality, and styling of our applications. Experience with healthcare, bioinformatics or life sciences is nice to have, but not required, but experience building web-based user interfaces and applications with complex, data-driven visualizations is a must.



  
 And be forewarned: This a challenging domain. We are not building standard, run-of-the-mill React or Angular applications. Our applications are built using substantial innovative custom technology to accomplish unique on-the-fly statistical and AI analysis of massive amounts of research data. It requires understanding of direct browser APIs to achieve necessary scalability and performance requirements. But you will have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions and innovations in an emerging field of technology.



 **Skills & requirements**



 **Technical Requirements:**


* Legally able to work in the U.S. Permanent residence is inside U.S. time zones.
* Strong attention to detail and visual design; please expect to share examples of previous work.
* Exceptional CSS, HTML, and TypeScript/JavaScript skills.
* Embrace functional, reactive, and object-oriented programming.
* Easily choose or write the best algorithm for consuming large, dynamic data sets.
* Experience designing beautiful web applications.
* Familiarity with modern development workflows and release cycles, using Agile-like methodologies.
* Experience with Node.js
* Experience with Git and modern JS development tools.


  

**Experience Requirements**


* 5+ years of JavaScript development
* You have strong communication skills and willingness to ask questions. We do not write implementation specs for you; you will be a business problem to solve and are expected to understand and explore the space of design alternatives to come up with a solution. Questions will occur and it is important that you be comfortable asking them and chasing down answers.
* You have extensive experience with web development, having done one or more substantial client/server applications.
* You can take any documented API and immediately begin building client-side functionality.
* You’ve done enough projects to identify what’s missing or unworkable in a wireframe or high-level set of design requirements, and have the basic design and UX chops to improvise when necessary.
* You know how to optimize website resources and front-end performance for data heavy JavaScript apps.
* You are well-versed in the classic front-end skills as well — you know your selectors, semantic tags, and cross-browser development.


**Bonus**


* Previous experience with biomedical software development
* Familiarity with leveraging our core libraries and frameworks (see Our Work for the main technologies we use).
* Familiarity with key value stores
* Experience with visualization frameworks such as D3 or similar","COMPANY SUMMARY Doctor Evidence is the leading medical intelligence platform for Life Sciences companies that enables users to identify breakthrough insights grounded in the vast universe of published medical information, proprietary data and real world evidence.

**Frontend Engineer**
=====================




FactoryFour is looking for a talented engineer to join our core web applications team, which is scaling its development in both internal and client-facing software. As a Frontend Engineer, you will be at the nexus of design, product and the FactoryFour API, bringing everything together to create the modern software platform that is disrupting the mindset of the manufacturing industry.  
 











#### **FactoryFour Vision**


Manufacturers are the foundation of our society, stimulating our economy and giving us the tools to go about our daily lives. However, they’re often held back by inadequate software systems to manage production the way they want, making it difficult to leverage their expertise as efficiently as possible. FactoryFour is committed to building software that is highly customizable, simple to use, and quick to deploy, so that manufacturers can efficiently build products and harness the increasingly digital future. 











##### **About the Role**


* Develop mobile-responsive and cross-browser compatible applications for users on a variety of devices
* Create design-forward applications that show just the right amount of information for each user
* Work with our API, which focuses on flexible data models with real time updates


##### **Previous Frontend Engineers have:**


* Created a highly customizable generator for forms, to accommodate a wide range of client-specific requirements
* Engineered and open-sourced a frontend caching utility to optimize our application load times
* Established a central toolkit of UI components for use across our web platforms


##### **About You**



 You are excited by new challenges and opportunities to learn and apply new technologies to everyday engineering. You're team-oriented, looking to share everything you learn and willing to give and take honest feedback for the sake of your team. You have an attention to detail, understanding that each pixel in a mockup has a purpose and should be implemented exactly so, but also raise questions when something doesn't translate between paper and screen. Most importantly, you know what you know and don't shy away from asking questions for everything else. 
 


**You have:**

* Experience in Computer Science or related field
* Proficiency with Git



**Bonus points:**

* Experience with ReactJS or other frontend Javascript frameworks
* Knowledge of Computer Science fundamentals
* Experience using RESTful API's
* Knowledge of good design and clean user interactions



##### **Our Process**


* Develop features using mockups from the design team
* Perform feature reviews with designers and product engineers, and code reviews with peers
* Deploy using our automated building and testing processes


##### **Our Frontend Stack:**


* Javascript (ReactJS)
* Git
* RESTful API
* GraphQL
* Pusher
* Testing: Protractor, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme
* Webpack
* Gitlab
* Bugsnag","EngineeringLos Angeles
